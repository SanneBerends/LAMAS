In order to model this game using epistemic logic, we simplified the game in a number of ways:

- Two players per game.
- Two cards per player.
- Only one iteration is played per game.
- Players can view their own cards throughout the entire game.
- Points on the cards go from 0 to 3.
- No special cards.
- After 'Bever' is said, the game stops immediately, so the other players do not get another turn.

The resulting deck contains cards with values from 0 to 3. Each value occurs five times in the deck, resulting in 20
cards in total. This means that during the game, there are enough instances of each card type such that both cards of 
both players could in theory have the same value.

We also assume that the players are rational agents, so they only draw cards from the deck or discard pile if this is 
beneficial to them, meaning that the number of points on that card is lower than the card they are going to switch it 
with. We also assume no other strategies than reaching the lowest sum of points are used, meaning that an player chooses 
to replace its card with the highest value by the new card.
