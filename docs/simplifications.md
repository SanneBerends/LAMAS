# Simplifications of the game
<!-- simplificatie
een plaatje van hoe het eruit ziet -->
In order to model this game using epistemic logic, we simplified the game in a number of ways:

- Two players per game.
- Two cards per player.
- Players can view their own cards throughout the entire game.
- Points on the card go from 0 to 4.
- No special cards.
- Only one round is played per game.
- After 'Bever' is said, the game stops immediately.

We also assume that the players are rational agents, so they only draw cards from the deck or discard pile if this is beneficial to them, meaning that the number of points on that card is lower than the card they are going to switch it with. We also assume no other strategies than reaching the lowest sum of points are used, meaning that no cards are drawn with higher or equal points just to confuse the other player.
