    <p>For this project, a simplified version of the game ‘Beverbende’ was modelled using epistemic logic for the strategy of the 
      players. Beverbende is a simple Dutch game, where players have 4 cards each, and their goal is to minimize the total worth 
      of their cards. During the game they can interchange their cards with cards from a deck. When they think their total card worth 
      is lower that that of other players, they say ‘Bever’ and the game ends. We propose the use of a Kripke model to show the 
      knowledge in the game, to guide the decision for a player to call ‘Bever’. The Kripke model is updated after public 
      announcements, which will be detailed later. The aim of this project is to examine whether with the use of the Kripke model, 
      a player can be certain to win when it calls ‘Bever’.

      the formal modal, an example run and finally a conclusion.
