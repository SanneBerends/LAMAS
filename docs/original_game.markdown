Beverbende is played with cards that contain 0 to 9 points. The aim of the game is to acquire the lowest sum of points 
with the four cards that are in front of each player. Each player has four cards, that are laid out face-down on the 
table in front of them. When the game starts, each player looks at the outer two of their own cards. The rest of the 
cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table, this is the deck. One card is flipped open next to the deck, 
this is the discard pile. Then taking turns, each player either takes a closed card from the deck, or an open card 
from the discard pile, looks at the value without showing the other players, and chooses to switch this card with one 
of their own. This way, players can reduce their points. When a player is convinced that their cards contain the lowest 
sum of all players, they say 'Bever'. After that, the other players play one more turn and then all the cards are turned 
around to count the points.

There are three special cards in the deck, allowing players to view one of their own hidden cards, switch one of their 
cards with a card of another player (without looking at either of the cards), or take an extra card from the deck if they
don't like the card they have drawn the first time. If, by the time the cards of all players are turned around to reveal
the points, players have these special cards in front of them, a card is drawn from the deck to replace that card.
Games are played with 2 to 6 players. A game consists of four rounds, and the scores are summed at the end to reveal the 
winner.

The way to win this game is by keeping track of the cards that are knowable. Obviously, you can know your own cards that 
you have seen or switched, and you can know cards from the other players if they take open cards from the discard pile. 
But there are more clues to pay attention to. If a player switches one of their card with a card from the deck, the 
other players know that the card they drew has a lower point count than the one they discarded. Also, when the special 
is card played that allows players to switch one of their cards with someone else, the other players can sometimes deduce 
that a higher-value card is switched for a lower-value card.

Despite these ways to keep track of cards, after 'Bever' is called by a confident player, the game can still change 
drastically because all the other players still get to play one round, where a lot can happen.
